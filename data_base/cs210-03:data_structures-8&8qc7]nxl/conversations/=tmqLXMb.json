    "question": "what is this class about?",
    "answer": "This course, CS210, focuses on the representation and operations of fundamental data structures. You will learn about arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, recursion, binary search trees, balanced trees, hash tables, and dynamic storage management, with an introduction to graphs. The course uses an object-oriented programming language, specifically C++.<br><br>Upon completion, you will be able to:<br><em>   Analyze and measure algorithm complexities.<br></em>   Write generic and reusable code in C++.<br><em>   Understand Inheritance, Interfaces, Polymorphism, and Abstract Data Types in C++.<br></em>   Apply design and development principles to construct software systems.<br><br><strong>Source:</strong> Syllabus → 'COURSE CATALOG DESCRIPTION' and 'GOALS FOR THIS COURSE'",

    "question": "what should i study for the most ?",
    "answer": "To best prepare for this course, you should focus your study efforts on the topics that carry the most weight in your final grade and are foundational to the course's learning objectives.<br><br>The most important areas to focus on are:<br><br><em>   <strong>Exams (Midterms and Final):</strong> These collectively make up 55% of your final grade (15% for each Midterm, 25% for the Final Exam). These will test your comprehensive understanding of all concepts covered.<br></em>   <strong>Programming Assignments:</strong> These make up 30% of your final grade (10% for each of the 3 assignments). These assess your ability to implement data structures and algorithms in C++.<br><br>### Key Study Areas<br><br>Based on the course syllabus, module content, and assignments, prioritize the following conceptual and practical areas:<br><br>1.  <strong>Algorithm Analysis (Big-O Notation):</strong><br>    <em>   <strong>Why:</strong> A primary goal of the course is to \"Analyze and measure complexities of algorithms.\" This topic is covered in modules and appears in Assignment 2 and Assignment 6.<br>    </em>   <strong>Focus:</strong> Understanding time and space complexity, recurrence relations, and analyzing common algorithms.<br>2.  <strong>Core Data Structures and their Operations:</strong><br>    <em>   <strong>Why:</strong> These are the building blocks of the course, explicitly listed in the catalog description and featured in multiple modules and assignments.<br>    </em>   <strong>Focus:</strong><br>        <em>   <strong>Linked Lists:</strong> Insertion, deletion, searching (Module: Linked Lists).<br>        </em>   <strong>Stacks & Queues:</strong> Basic operations (push, pop, enqueue, dequeue) and their applications (Module: Stacks & Queues).<br>        <em>   <strong>Priority Queues & Heaps:</strong> Heap properties, heapify, insert, deleteMin, and Heap Sort. This is critical for Assignment 4 and Programming Assignment 3 (Module: Priority Queues & Heaps).<br>        </em>   <strong>Trees:</strong> Binary Search Trees (BSTs), AVL Trees (rotations, balance factors), and Red-Black Trees (insertion, rebalancing). Covered in Assignment 5 and Assignment 6 (Module: Trees).<br>3.  <strong>Graphs and Graph Algorithms:</strong><br>    <em>   <strong>Why:</strong> \"Introduction to graphs\" is in the catalog description, and Programming Assignment 3 is dedicated entirely to implementing Prim's algorithm using an adjacency matrix and a min-heap.<br>    </em>   <strong>Focus:</strong> Representing graphs (adjacency matrix), Prim's algorithm for Minimum Spanning Trees (MSTs), and utilizing a min-heap.<br>4.  <strong>C++ Programming:</strong><br>    <em>   <strong>Why:</strong> The course explicitly uses C++ and requires original C++ code for all projects.<br>    </em>   <strong>Focus:</strong> Strong C++ fundamentals, object-oriented programming (Inheritance, Interfaces, Polymorphism, Abstract Data Types), and writing generic, reusable code.<br><br>### Source(s)<br><br><em>   Syllabus → 'GRADING', 'COURSE CATALOG DESCRIPTION', 'GOALS FOR THIS COURSE'<br></em>   Assignment Descriptions (Assignment 4, Assignment 5, Assignment 6, Programming Assignment 3)<br>*   Course Modules (Analysis of Algorithms, Linked Lists, Stacks & Queues, Priority Queues & Heaps, Trees)",
