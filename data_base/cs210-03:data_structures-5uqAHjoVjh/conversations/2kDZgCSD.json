    "answer": "This class, CS210, focuses on data structures and algorithms, using an object-oriented programming language, specifically C++. You will learn about various data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, binary search trees, balanced trees, and hash tables, as well as an introduction to graphs. A key component of the course is analyzing and measuring the complexities of algorithms and writing generic, reusable C++ code.<br><br><strong>Key details:</strong><br><em>   <strong>Focus Areas:</strong> Data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, binary search trees, balanced trees, hash tables, graphs) and algorithm analysis.<br></em>   <strong>Programming Language:</strong> C++ (using CLion).<br>*   <strong>Learning Outcomes:</strong> Analyze algorithm complexities, write generic C++ code, understand OOP concepts (inheritance, interfaces, polymorphism, abstract data types), and apply design principles to software construction.<br><br><strong>Source:</strong> Syllabus → 'COURSE CATALOG DESCRIPTION', 'GOALS FOR THIS COURSE'",
