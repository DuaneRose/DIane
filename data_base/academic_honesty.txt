At [College Name], generative AI and similar tools may support learning, but they must be used responsibly, transparently, and only as allowed by the course. Unless a syllabus or instructor explicitly permits AI for a task, you must assume it is not allowed. When AI use is permitted, you are required to disclose it clearly (naming the tool and date/version), describe how it was used (e.g., brainstorming, outlining, grammar only), and give proper attribution to any AI-generated language, code, images, data, or citations you include. Your submission must remain your own work: you are responsible for verifying accuracy, correcting errors and hallucinations, and meeting the assignment’s learning objectives without outsourcing the intellectual work the course intends to assess.

Certain uses are always prohibited unless explicitly authorized: generating or editing graded answers wholesale; producing code or solutions for individual (non-collaborative) assignments; fabricating sources, quotes, data, or citations; and concealing or misrepresenting AI assistance. Instructors may require drafts, version histories, or brief oral explanations to confirm authorship; automated AI detectors alone will not be used as sole evidence, but may prompt further review. Violations of this policy constitute academic misconduct and may result in penalties ranging from resubmission or reduced/zero credit to course failure and, for repeated or severe cases, institutional sanctions. When in doubt, ask your instructor before using AI. Responsible, disclosed, and limited use of AI can enhance learning; undisclosed or unauthorized use undermines it.
